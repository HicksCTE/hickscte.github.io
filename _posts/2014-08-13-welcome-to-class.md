  <p>Hey there! Mr. Hicks here. Welcome to my classroom! This class is going to be a little bit different than most of your other classes. We'll do a lot of our individual learning here on HicksCTE, and then we'll spend our class-time discussing, building, sharing, and connecting with others.</p>
  <p>This is one of my very favorite classes to teach. I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I enjoy teaching it. Now, let's get down to business.</p>
