### Class Outline

* Finish Traction Channel Advertising Plan
* Peer Review
* Make changes

### What Should Be Ready Today

1. Your Traction Channel Advertising Plan. Remember, we've spent nearly 20% of the term on this plan.

### Peer Review

This is an opportunity for you to work with another group as a consultant. You will review their work, give feedback, and they will get the chance to apply it to improve their business.

Mr. Hicks will assign you a group to consult with. Have someone from that group share their document with you. Review the document. Fill out the [peer review form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1OIDwIUoIRgd8FJ9DpVqm86dGMPCxooFV-K-DBw3lZvQ/viewform).

### Make Changes

Mr. Hicks will give you the feedback your group received. Take it and apply it before Mr. Hicks looks at your document and efforts to build traction.
