### Class Outline

* Updated Lean Canvas
* Partnership Agreements

### What Should Be Ready Today

1. You should be working on your second set of assumptions. First assumption presentation was due midnight on Friday last week. Your second assumption (due Friday) should be based on a version of your Minimum Viable Product.

### Update Your Lean Canvas

Now that your group has finished a few more experiments on your assumptions, you should update your Lean Canvas to reflect the results. Remove false assumptions, add new information or ideas.

### What is a Partnership Agreement?

A partnership agreement is a document, sometimes contractual, that outlines the responsibilities and ownership of each partner in the business. It is super important that you work on an agreement, however informal, to get everyone on the same page regarding work and income opportunities.

I've seen best friends and even family members ruin relationships because they went into business with each other without a clear description of what each person would be responsible for.

### What should be included in a Partnership Agreement?

1. *A specific description of all of the jobs to be done for your business*. Your Lean Canvas should be a great resource for this. Be very specific on what the responsibilities are.

Bad Example: Marketing
Good example: Creating and distributing flyers, setting up Facebook ad campaigns, and creating a script for everyone to use for door to door sales.

Here are a few things that you and your partners should consider when defining responsibilities:

* Accounting
* Collecting money
* Operations - making sure stuff gets done
* Training employees
* Marketing Platform - how and where people buy
* Marketing Promotion - flyers, ads, websites, referrals, etc
* Marketing Product - planning, delivery, etc

2. *Distributing the jobs to be done*. Assign each area of responsibility to one of the partners. Who's in charge or each job?

3. *Assign equity/ownership percentages*. If someone is only doing 10% of the work, they should not get 25% of the profit. Consider how each partner in your group is contributing, and what percentage of the company they should own as a result.

### More Partnership Agreement Details

I've created a [Partnership Agreement Template](https://docs.google.com/a/alpinedistrict.org/document/d/1ZgQtPXnJbAxGyVmUORQVc-LlswbnAKeO0Jce3bK8g_E/edit#heading=h.5g3k2j1i9t7d). Make a copy as a starting point for your group.

Do not make this a hardcore negotiation where you get upset and angry. Most of you are good friends and are working together to make your business successful. No business in this class is going to turn into a giant company, and we are not making a legal document. The important part is that you understand that you should go through this process when starting a business so that everyone is on the same page.
