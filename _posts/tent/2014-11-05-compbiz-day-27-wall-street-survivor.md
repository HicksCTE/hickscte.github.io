### Wall Street Survivor

Now that we've talked about how you're in a high-stakes game against some of the most sophisticated computers in the world, let's see if you can survive on Wall Street.

Each of you will start with a portfolio of $10,000. A significant amount for you 14-15 year olds! You have 7 weeks to turn your $10,000 portfolio into the biggest amount possible. 

This is your opportunity to dive into short-term stock market trading. Choose your favorite companies, research high fliers, or bet against losers.

You will have until December 18, our last day of class before break, to compete for prizes.

1. **First Place** - 5 Extra Credit Points
2. **Second Place** - 3 Extra Credit Points
3. **Third Place** - 1 Extra Credit Points
