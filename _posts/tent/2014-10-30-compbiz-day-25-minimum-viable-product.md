### Class Outline

* Minimum Viable Product

### What Should Be Ready Today

1. You should be working on your second set of assumptions. First assumption presentation due midnight tomorrow. Your second assumption (due next week) should be based on a version of your Minimum Viable Product.

### What is a Minimum Viable Product?

A Minimum Viable Product is the minimum set of features necessary to get useful feedback from customers.

Simplify. Break it down. What do you need to do so you can get valuable feedback from customers?

### Why build a Minimum Viable Product?

Our entire class has been based on validating our business. After we brainstormed ideas, we have gone through a series of identifying assumptions, testing those assumptions, and making decisions based on those tests.

#### Customer Interviews

We assumed that our idea solved a real problem for our target market.

We talked to customers to identify if the problem was real, and if our solution was a potential fit.

We made decisions whether to continue with that idea based on the interview responses.

#### Lean Canvas

We identified a number of assumptions relating to our problem, solution, markets, channels, costs, and revenue.

We each tested one assumption. Most of the class did so with customer surveys or fliers.

We made decisions on whether that assumption was valid or invalid based on the results.

#### Minimum Viable Product

We will take our assumptions and create a Minimum Viable Product.

We will test our product by selling it to real customers and getting feedback from them.

We will make decisions and adjustments based on our ability to sell the product and on our customer feedback after they have used the product.
