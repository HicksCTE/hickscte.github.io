### What Should Be Ready Today

1. You should have a list of 4 traction channels that you plan to experiment with over the next 2-3 weeks, and ideas of how you want to implement them.

### Public Relations Stunts

We talked about PR Stunts as a way to get attention from media and potential customers. Read the following examples of PR Stunts. Ask yourself why it worked (or didn't), and what the messaging was.

* [Airline Surprises Passengers With Christmas Gifts](http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/trending-now/airline-surprises-passengers-with-christmas-gifts-upon-arrival-155701369.html)
* [Felix Baumgartner's Jump From Space](http://www.redbull.com/us/en/adventure/stories/1331615638318/rare-10-minute-clip-of-the-historic-space-jump)
* [WePay Uses 600 Pounds of Ice at Paypal Conference](http://techcrunch.com/2010/10/26/wepay-ice-paypal/)
* [Will It Blend?](http://mashable.com/2013/02/21/blendtec-will-it-blend/)

Many of these Unconventional PR methods turned into viral videos or memes. Let's look at a few more successful viral campaigns:

Are there any cool PR things you could do in your neighborhood or around your customers that could grab attention?

### Social Media

Viral Campaigns and Social Media go together hand-in-hand. Social Media is how the viral stuff gets shared. But Social Media is also a great place to do **paid advertising**.

* [Twitter Promoted Tweets](https://biz.twitter.com/en-gb/products/promoted-tweets). Target by topic, hashtag, interest, gender, location.
* [Facebook Advertising](https://www.facebook.com/advertising/). Target by topic, page, interest, gender, location.
* [Pinterest Promoted Pins](https://ads.pinterest.com/). Pick a pin. Decide who sees it. Pay for visits.
* [YouTube Advertisements](https://www.youtube.com/yt/advertise/). Check out [an example](http://videopower.org/generate-over-100-leads-a-week-youtube-ads-case-study/).

### Landing Pages

Unconventional PR and social media advertising get people curious about your product. You need to have somewhere that people can go to contact you, schedule a visit, or get started with your service.

A great business website can take weeks or months to plan, write content, take photos, and more. But we can get most of the benefit without a lot of the hassle with a simple landing page.

#### Landing Page Basics

Two essential ingredients for a landing page:

1. Tell the visitor what you do
2. Give the visitor a Call to Action

A Call to Action asks the visitor to *do something*. Submit a form. Call to schedule an appointment. Sign up for a newsletter. Sign their kid up for your camp. Buy your service. Whatever.

Here are a few examples of simple, effective landing pages:

* [Unsnooze](http://unsnooze.com)
* [Wired In](http://wearewired.in)
* [Help Brent](http://www.helpbrent.com/)

#### Tools for Setting Up a Website

If you want to get serious with your website, there are some great tools out there. Some are free, some are paid. Squarespace ($10/mo) is my favorite. But here are some other options:

* [Instapage](https://www.instapage.com/)
* [Squarespace](http://squarespace.com)
* [Google Sites](http://sites.google.com)
* [Weebly](http://weebly.com)
* [Wix](http://wix.com)
* [Square](https://squareup.com/sell-online)
* [Unbounce](http://unbounce.com)
* [Wordpress](http://wordpress.com)

### What You Should Work On

Traction Channels:

1. Unconventional PR

Try and plan out an unconventional PR or viral move that you could make that would get attention for your business.

2. Social Ads

Choose a marketing platform, describe in detail who your target market is. Plan advertisements for it. Set up your campaign.

Talk to Mr. Hicks about potential money to help you get started with your ads.

3. Website

Use Instapage (or another tool) to create a landing page for your business. It's free for up to 100 visitors a month. Remember to include information about what you do, and have a call to action.
