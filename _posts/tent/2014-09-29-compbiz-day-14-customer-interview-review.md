### Class Outline

* Fix any uploading/sharing issues
* Review customer interviews in groups
* Eliminate, refine, or add to ideas
* Plan remaining two interviews

### What Should Be Ready Today

1. Three videos of 8-15 minute customer interviews for each group member

### Fix Any Uploading/Sharing Issues

In your group, try and fix any lingering uploading or sharing issues. If you try with your whole group and can't get anything uploaded, come talk to Mr. Hicks.

### Review Customer Interviews in Groups

You should watch and discuss your interviews in your groups. Take notes on what you learned from each interview. Some ideas for note taking:

1. Specific phrases used to describe how the problem was hard
2. Specific instances of trying to solve the problem, especially if they were paying for those potential solutions
3. Changes you can make to have your idea better solve problems the customer has
4. New ideas that you got from the interview

Remember why we interview customers as you choose to eliminate, refine, or add to your ideas:

### Why Interview Customers?

Three things should happen as you interview potential customers about your ideas:

#### 1. Eliminate Bad Ideas

Customer interviews will tell you if your idea isn't going to work. Here are some signs you should eliminate the idea:

1. Your customer wasn't able to tell you something hard about the last time they had the problem.
2. Your customer cannot share a specific attempt to solve this problem.
3. Your customer acts like their current solution is just fine.
4. You do not have a clear better solution than what they are currently doing (better, cheaper, faster, easier). 

If your customer has never done anything to solve the problem, you are facing an uphill battle trying to educate your customers. This can be good for future business ideas, but is beyond the scope of this class. 

#### 2. Refine Your Ideas

You will have a better idea of what your customer wants. You will be able to change and improve your idea to better solve problems your customer has. You will learn specific words and phrases to use when you build your marketing materials.

#### 3. Give You New Ideas

Customer interviews are about learning what your customer wants. Talking about problems they will pay to solve is a great way to come up with new and better ideas. If you hear something in the interview that gives you another idea, investigate it, it may be the right idea for you to move forward with.


### Plan Your Remaining Interviews

You have many options now. You and your group must determine what the best forward course is. Here are some potential ways to move forward with your remaining interviews:

1. Choose one concrete idea for everyone in the group, go and interview about it. This is a great option if your weekend interviews helped your group solidify on one great idea.
2. Choose new ideas for everyone in the group and go interview. This is a great option if none of your interviews were very promising. 
3. Mix and match. Have some group members look into new ideas, have other dig deper into the ideas you interviewed about.

#### Schedule Your Remaining 2 Interviews

You may pull out your phones or start e-mailing people to schedule your interviews.

### Uploading Your Interview Videos to Google Drive

Use the following guides from Google to upload your videos from your devices:

1. [Upload videos from an iOS Device (iPhone, iPod, iPad)](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2763076?hl=en) 
2. [Upload videos from an Android Device (Android, Samsung, Kindle)](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2763724?hl=en)
3. To upload from a regular camera, plug in the camera to a computer and drag and drop the file into your Google Drive account on the web
