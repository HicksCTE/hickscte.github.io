### Class Outline

* Offline Advertisements
* Desktop Publishing Basics

### What Should Be Ready Today

1. You should be building your list of traction channels you plan to explore, along with your specific plans for putting them into action.

### Offline Advertisements

Offline advertisements are great for reaching hyper-local target audiences. Billboards, TV ads, radio spots, magazine ads are excellent offline advertising platforms. For this class, you may be focusing on hand-delivered flyers or posters.

Offline advertisements should be designed to do the following:

1. Attention - Grab the attention of the potential customer
2. Interest - Create an interest in your product
3. Desire - Give them a reason to want your product
4. Action - Invite them to act, call, schedule an appointment, etc

### Desktop Publishing Basics

There are two simple rules that I want you to learn before you design your flyers. Balance, and white space.

#### Balance

Things look better when they are balanced. Read [this article](http://www.onextrapixel.com/2011/08/25/concept-and-factors-of-balance-in-web-design/) on balance. It uses Web Design as it's focus, but it also applies to all types of visual design.

#### Whitespace

This is a bit more of an advanced, nuanced concept. Take a look at [this article](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/white-space-in-web-design-what-it-is-and-why-you-should-use-it) on Whitespace and why you should use it. Again, it's focus is on web design, but applies to all types of design.

### Great Tools for Desktop Publishing

* [Canva](https://www.canva.com)
* Microsoft Publisher
* Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator

I would recommend Canva for this class. It's awesome. Be aware that some of the stock photography on Canva costs money. You can upload your own images if they don't have a free image that you like.

Others have used Google Docs or Microsoft Word. Those are fine, but they are not specifically designed for this purpose. Try one of the other tools and see what you think.

### What You Should Work On

Traction Channels:

1. Offline Advertising

Each person in your group should design a professional looking flyer, handout, or poster for your business.

Your flyers will be checked for the following elements:

1. Follows the Attention, Interest, Desire, Action pattern for successful flyers.
2. Is pleasing to look at, with proper use of balance and whitespace.

Share your flyers with Mr. Hicks. After they are approved, Mr. Hicks will help you print them to start handing out.
