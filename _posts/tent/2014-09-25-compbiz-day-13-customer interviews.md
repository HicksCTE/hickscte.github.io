### The Customer Interview

<p class="message">This is the capstone project for this first term. Success in your customer interviews is a huge indicator of the success of your business this semester. Students who don't finish the interviews will have an Incomplete in the course until they are finished.</p>

Follow along with the [presentation deck](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/74616/intro/tresx%20customer%20interview%20deck/index.html).

<p class="message">Objective: Interview 5 potential non-family-member customers to eliminate, refine, or generate new ideas. Film the interview. Upload it to Google Drive. Share the interviews with Mr. Hicks. Videos of the interview are *essential*.</p>

#### Sample Questions

1. Tell me about the last time __________.
2. What is the hardest part about that?
3. Why was that hard?
4. What, if anything, have you done to solve that problem?
5. Why is that not awesome?

#### Additional Questions

2. What is your typical budget for these types of projects?
3. How high of a priority is this for you?
4. What factors are most important when deciding who to hire?
5. What has been your biggest frustration when you have hired people in the past?


### Why Interview Customers?

Three things should happen as you interview potential customers about your ideas:

#### 1. Eliminate Bad Ideas

Customer interviews will tell you if your idea isn't going to work. Here are some signs you should eliminate the idea:

1. Your customer wasn't able to tell you something hard about the last time they had the problem.
2. Your customer cannot share a specific attempt to solve this problem.
3. Your customer acts like their current solution is just fine.
4. You do not have a clear better solution than what they are currently doing (better, cheaper, faster, easier). 

If your customer has never done anything to solve the problem, you are facing an uphill battle trying to educate your customers. This can be good for future business ideas, but is beyond the scope of this class. 

#### 2. Refine Your Ideas

You will have a better idea of what your customer wants. You will be able to change and improve your idea to better solve problems your customer has. You will learn specific words and phrases to use when you build your marketing materials.

#### 3. Give You New Ideas

Customer interviews are about learning what your customer wants. Talking about problems they will pay to solve is a great way to come up with new and better ideas. If you hear something in the interview that gives you another idea, investigate it, it may be the right idea for you to move forward with.


### What Next?

#### Practice With a Neighbor

Practice asking your questions with a neighbor. You will be interviewing at least 5 people this weekend, get comfortable with the process. Do not rush the interviews.

#### Schedule Your 5 Interviews

You may pull out your phones or start e-mailing people to schedule your interviews.
