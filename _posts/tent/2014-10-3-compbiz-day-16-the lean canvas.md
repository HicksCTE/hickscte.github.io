### What Should Be Ready Today

1. One idea backed by customer interview support that your group is prepared to move forward with.

### The Lean Canvas

Many businesses write a Business Plan. An intense, detailed document that outlines every aspect of the business they plan to run. But this isn't a good idea when you are just starting, you don't really know much about what your business is or can be yet.

It's important to test your assumptions and make changes along the way. This is called iterating on your idea. You make an assumption, you test it, and if it works you move forward, if it doesn't you make a change.

The Lean Canvas helps you do that.

#### The Video

Ash Maurya talks about the Lean Canvas in the video 'Capture Your Business Model in 20 Minutes - Lean Canvas' on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o8uYdUaFR4).

We will watch this during class, and then you and your group will have time to go through the Lean Canvas using our posters and post-it notes.

#### Lean Canvas Overview

1. *Problem*. Write the top 3 problems that your customers have.
2. *Solution*. Write down 2-3 ways that your business will solve that problem (easier, better, faster, cheaper).
3. *Key Metrics*. Besides sales and revenue, what will your group measure to determine the success of your business?
4. *Unique Value Propisition*. One single reason that explains why you are better than competing solutions (easier, better, faster, cheaper).
5. *Unfair Advantage*. Why are you easier, better, faster, or cheaper than your competition?
6. *Channels*. What is your path to customers? Will you go door-to-door? Distribute flyers and follow up? Talk to business owners? Social marketing?
7. *Customer Segments*. Your business idea was created based on one specific target market. What other target markets would also be interested in your product?
8. *Cost Structure*. What do you have to pay for to run your business? How much will you pay?
9. *Revenue Streams*. How will you make money? What will your customers pay you for? How will they pay you (online, check/cash, credit card)? How much will they pay?

### Business Model Generation

Your group should go and make a first iteration of your business model. We will revisit the Lean Canvas regularly throughout class as we test assumptions and change our businesses.
