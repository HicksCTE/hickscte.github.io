### What is traction?

[Traction][1] is an excellent book on growing your business. A lot of it is targeted to larger scale startups, but there are plenty of lessons to learn for your businesses now.

The book describes the following:

>Traction is a sign that your company is taking off. It's obvious in your core metrics.

and

What are your core metrics you defined on your Lean Canvas?

Your business has traction when your core metrics are showing growth.

>Traction is basically quantitative (measurable) evidence of customer demand... You'll know it when you see it.

Does your business have traction? Is it sticky? Do you have happy customers who would come back?

### Getting Customers

We can use what are called Traction Channels to find customers for your business. Here's an outline of the different channels outlined in the book.

1. Viral Marketing
2. Public Relations
3. Unconventional PR
4. Search Engine Marketing
5. Social and Display Ads
6. Offline Ads
7. Search Engine Optimization
8. Content Marketing
9. Email Marketing
10. Engineering as Marketing
11. Targeting Blogs
12. Business Development
13. Sales
14. Affiliate Programs
15. Existing Platforms
16. Trade Shows
17. Offline Events
18. Speaking Engagements
19. Community Building

As I mentioned above, a lot of these are outside the scope of your business. The important thing is that you recognize which ones may work for you. I would probably narrow the list down to the following for your early stage businesses:

#### 1. Unconventional PR

> Unconventional PR involves doing something exceptional (like publicity stunts) to draw media attention.

Don't plan on doing anything that will get you in trouble. But doing something creative and interesting to get attention is a tried and true method.

#### 2. Social and Display Ads

> Ads on popular on sites like reddit, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and hundreds of other niche sites can be a powerful and scalable way to reach new customers.

We've covered Facebook advertising, and it is likely a great fit for most of your businesses.

#### 3. Offline Ads

> Offline ads include TV spots, radio commercials, billboards, infomercials, newspaper and magazine ads, as well as flyers and other local advertisements.

Many of you are planning on making flyers. This can be a great way to reach your nearby customers, particularly in your neighborhood.

#### 4. Sales

> Sales is primarily focused on creating processes to directly exchange product for dollars.

Sometimes it just takes talking to people. Come up with a script of how you will sell to people.

#### 5. Affiliate Programs

> Companies like Hostgator, GoDaddy and Sproud Social have robust affiliate programs that have allowed them to reach hundreds of thousands of customers in a cost effective way.

Affiliate programs are a way to encourage people to share. For example, 'Bring 3 friends and get one free' or something along those lines.

#### 6. Community Building

> Companies like Zappos, Wikipedia, and Stack Exchange have all grown by forming passionate communities around their products.

Building a community of like-minded people around your business can be a huge way to get your business to grow, and to create raving fans of your business. Stickers, t-shirts, forums, or anything else to help people feel a sense of belonging and comfort are great.
