### Class Outline

* Testing Your Assumptions Presentations

### What Should Be Ready Today

1. Evidence supporting or refuting one assumption for each person in each group.

### Enter Results

Enter your experiment results into your Google Doc you prepared last time.

Each group will give a 4-5 minute presentation describing each assumption (hypothesis), experiment, and results. You do not need a slide deck, just present off of your Doc.

Presentations will be graded on the following:

1. At least one assumption per person in the group was tested.
2. The experiment focused on proving or disproving the assumption.
3. The experiment was completed, and results were discussed, final decisions were presented professionally.
4. Students demonstrated good presentation skills, specifically, not reading directly off of the Doc.
