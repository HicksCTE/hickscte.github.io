Enter your experiment results into your Google Doc you prepared last time.

Each group will give a 4-5 minute presentation describing each assumption (hypothesis), experiment, and results. Slide decks should consist of the following:

Slide 1: Your Assumption
Slide 2: How you tested your assumption
Slide 3: Evidence that you did the test (video, photos)
Slide 4: Conclusion

Presentations will be graded on the following:

1. At least one assumption per person in the group was tested.
2. The experiment focused on proving or disproving the assumption.
3. The experiment was completed, and results were discussed, final decisions were presented professionally.
4. Students demonstrated good presentation skills, specifically, not reading directly off of the Doc.
