### Class Outline

* Assign Groups
* Solve School Problems (brainstorming ideas)
* Assign Target Markets
* Idea Generation Discussion

### Assign Groups

* [Fill out the Group Survey](https://docs.google.com/a/alpinedistrict.org/forms/d/1lVl6_zzRYXadRdd9TSskZ2IVbv-rtkMRi7WMXbNovgw/viewform?usp=send_form)

Mr. Hicks will use this survey to create your groups for your semester project. After you finish the survey, polish your Solving School Problems document. Make sure you have your best ideas highlighted in Green and your least helpful ideas highlighted in Red.

### Solving School Problems

<p class="message">We already worked on this. We just need to finish the activity with the switching, refining, and presenting.</p>

Choose one of the following problems and brainstorm 20 ways to solve it. 10 good ways, 10 weird ways. Use your brains!

1. Reduce garbage in the hallways
2. Increase attendance at school plays and concerts
3. Eliminate bullying

Write down the best ideas on a piece of paper. Write down the worst ideas on a separate piece of paper.

#### Switch Problems

You will switch randomly with another group in class. You will prepare a 4 minute presentation based on their bank of ideas. The presentation will be pitched to Mr. Perkins.

Here's the twist. You have to present on the ideas highlighted in Red. Refine those ideas to be great. Think outside the box. Make the ideas yours. Modify them as you need to make them appropriate for the presentation.

<p class="message">The purpose of this activity is to recognize that even bad ideas can be turned into good ones. When we are at this early brainstorming phase, it's important not to censor out ideas just because they sound a little crazy. We'll edit our lists later!</p>

### Assign Target Markets

You will draw the target market for your group out of a box. I will give certain groups the opportunity to draw a secondary target market if you can give me a good reason why.

#### Niche your market down one more step
ex. Instead of '16-18 year old girls at Lehi Junior High School' add one more qualifier '16-18 year old girls at Lehi Junior High School that own their own car'

You can change your qualifier later. But this gives a good starting place for brainstorming ideas.

### Solving Business Problems

Everyone in class should brainstorm 50 business ideas for a specific target market.

* Create a Google Document, title it with the name of your Target Market
* Create a table with two columns, 'Problem' and 'Solution'
* Brainstorm 25 business ideas to solve problems for your assigned Target Market
* Highlight Problem column Green, Yellow or Red based on target market willingness and ability to pay
* Highlight Solution column Green, Yellow or Red based on your willingness and ability to provide that service
