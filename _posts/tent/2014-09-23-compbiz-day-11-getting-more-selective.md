### What Should Be Ready Today

Everyone in class should brainstorm 50 business ideas for a specific target market.

* Create a Google Document, title it with the name of your Target Market
* Create a table with two columns, 'Problem' and 'Solution'
* Brainstorm 25 business ideas to solve problems for your assigned Target Market
* Highlight Problem column Green, Yellow or Red based on target market willingness and ability to pay
* Highlight Solution column Green, Yellow or Red based on your willingness and ability to provide that service

### Validating Your Ideas

We will discuss [validating your ideas](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/74616/intro/uolx%20validating%20your%20idea/index.html), which is the process of narrowing down your giant list of business ideas to a handful that we can dive into further.

Your time is too valuable to waste. High achievers will use tactics like the Pay Certainty test and Customer Validation Interviews to determine the best idea to pursue. You can vastly improve your chances of success when you know there is a willing market to pay for your service.

### The Gauntlet of Fire

It's time for a reality check. Some of your ideas are terrible.

It's time to take them into the [Gauntlet of Fire](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/74616/intro/tresx%20idea%20gauntlet%20of%20fire/index.html). Where bad ideas go to die.

Go through the Gauntlet of Fire for each of your remaining ideas on your list.

### Up Next: Customer Validation Interviews
