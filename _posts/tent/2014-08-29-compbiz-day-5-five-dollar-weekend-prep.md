### Class Outline

* $5 Weekend Preparation

### $5 Weekend Preparation

Great entrepreneurs have a flexible but strong plan. You should have a plan heading into this weekend. Make sure you have answers to the following questions:

1. What problem are you going to solve for people?
2. What is your solution?
3. How much will you charge?
4. How will you find customers?
5. When will you do it?

Also, be prepared for the presentation. A couple of guidelines:

* Blog posts should be 500 words
* Class presentations should be 3 minutes
* Video presentations should be 1-3 minutes

Include the following: problem, solution, customer feedback, total time invested, how much you made. Slides may consist of one image or one sentence. All presentations should be shared with Mr. Hicks via Google Drive before class starts next time.
