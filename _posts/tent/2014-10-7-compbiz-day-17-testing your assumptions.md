### Class Outline

* The Lean Canvas
* Business Model Generation

### What Should Be Ready Today

1. Lean Canvas poster with Post-It notes of your assumptions on the different areas.
2. A clear photo of your Lean Canvas sent to Mr. Hicks through Google Drive.

### Testing Your Assumptions

Even though you have brainstormed hundreds of ideas and done customer interviews to narrow down your list, you have made a number of assumptions that will make your break the success of your business.

Today we will identify 3 assumptions that we can test, and devise experiments to prove or disprove each assumption with our customers. We will use this process continually to improve or refine our ideas.

Let's walk through an example.

### Example: The Window Washers

Here is an overview of a Lean Canvas poster by a group in one of our classes.

<div class = "message" markdown="1">
#### Problem
- people need clean windows
- please don't have time
- potential customers don't know that washers are reliable and affordable

#### Solution
- provide window cleaning
- be flexible in service times
- provide reliable service

#### Unique Value Proposition
- cheaper than professionals
- can use school project as a hook

#### Unfair Advantage
- nothing listed

#### Customer Segments
- people with kids
- people with dirty windows
- people that are really busy

#### Key Metrics
- nothing listed

#### Channels
- social media
- door to door
- heads up flyers

#### Cost Structure
- squeegees / blades
- soap and water
- ladder
- will break even after one house

#### Revenue Stream
- $4 for a regular window / $5 for a large window
- $7 for a door and screen
</div>

Let's identify 3-5 assumptions that we should test. Which ones would you choose?

### Testing Assumptions

I've identified 5 assumptions to test. Here they are:

1. Potential customers don't know that window washers are reliable and affordable
2. We can provide a reliable service
3. We can use school project as a hook for customers
4. Social media as a customer channel
5. People will pay $4-5/window for window cleaning

How can I test each one of those assumptions with measureable results? Let's brainstorm a few ideas:

<div class="message" markdown="1">
#### Potential customers don't know that window washers are reliable and affordable
- Create a survey asking people if they know about window washer options.
- Ask 10 neighbors if they knew that there were reliable, cheap window washing options.

#### We can provide a reliable service
- Do the service for free for 3 people, get customer feedback on what could go better [^1]

[^1] this would prove 3 things, that your group will actually meet together to provide the service, that people are willing to have the service done, and that you can do the service reliably, otherwise you will get feedback to improve your service.

#### We can use school project as a hook for customers
- Talk to 20 potential customers (neighbors), mention the school project with 10 of them, don't mention the school project to the other 10, measure the interest level of each group and see if school project makes a meaningful difference.

#### Social media as a customer channel
- Send out a Facebook message from own or parent social media accounts, gauge how many potential customers respond and set up an appointment.

#### People will pay $4-5/window for window cleaning
- Create 40 flyers, 20 of them with a lower price point ($3-4), 20 with a higher price point ($4-5), with a different phone number on each one. Pass them out in the same neighborhood. Measure which one gets more phone calls.

### Plan Your Own

Here's what you need to do today:

1. Go through your Lean Canvas poster. 
2. Identify 5 assumptions you should test this week.
3. Create a Google Doc outlining your 5 assumptions, and 1-2 ways to test each one. Your tests should be written as paragraphs, detailing to Mr. Hicks what you're planning to do and how it will help you prove your assumption.
4. Compare your list with another group. The group you work with should help you improve your designed tests.
5. Prepare anything you need to test your assumptions before Monday next week (flyers, social media messages, prices, days you can work, etc.)

This is not your final project! We are still improving your business idea. If you make money during your tests, awesome! If not, that's OK. Remember that this is all to test assumptions on your idea before you move forward.

### Go and Do

Your project this week is to test your assumptions. Go and do your tests that you designed. You may divide and conquer, assigning each person in your group to one test, or you may tackle the tests together. Make a decision and get it done this week. 

Add your test results to your Google Document as you complete your tests. We will review the tests on Monday.
