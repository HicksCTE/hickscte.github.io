title: Introducing Base
standards:
  - name: 'You can place standards in the sidebar.'
---

Base is a brazen two-column [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that pairs a prominent sidebar with uncomplicated content. It's based on Hyde and [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler[^1].

### Built on Poole

Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as an upstanding and effective foundation for Jekyll themes by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). Poole, and every theme built on it (like Base here) includes the following:

* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404](/404), [RSS feed](/atom.xml), posts, and [example page](/about))
* Mobile friendly design and development
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)

### Base features

In addition to the features of Hyde, Base adds the following:

* Sidebar includes support for post specific standards
* Font Awesome icons with standard implementation <i class="fa-thumbs-up" />

### Browser support

Base is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

Base is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/Base">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!
