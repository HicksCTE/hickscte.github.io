<div class="message">
  <p>Hey there! Mr. Hicks here. Welcome to my classroom! This class is going to be a little bit different than most of your other classes. We'll do a lot of our individual learning here on HicksCTE, and then we'll spend our class-time discussing, building, sharing, and connecting with others.</p>
  <p>This is one of my very favorite classes to teach. I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I enjoy teaching it. Now, let's get down to business.</p>

### Introduction to Class

#### What is CTE Intro?

CTE Intro is a year long course designed to help students explore careers, use technology, and develop beginning skills in business, technology, and in the home. In the business rotation of the course, we will look at business, technology, marketing, entrepreneurship, and software engineering.

#### Who is Mr. Hicks?

You'll learn a lot about me throughout the term. But here's a quick look at some things that are important to me.

### Seating Chart

I know we don't like seating charts. But we have one so I can learn your names better. We'll set it up during class.

### Logging In

Your login will be the same for the following services:

* Active Directory (school computers)
* Skyward
* Google

Your username is your Skyward username. It has the following format:

* First five letters of your last name
* First three letters of your first name
* Three digits, usually 000

If your name were Jack Johnson, your username would be: johnsjac000 (or potentially johnsjac001, 002, 003, or higher).

If you don't know your Skyward ID, ask me and I can look it up.

### Google Accounts

We will use your school Google account almost every day of class. We will use it for Gmail, Classroom, Drive, and storage.

Log in using your newly reset password.

### Daily Schedule

Every day we will follow a similar schedule. Here it is:

* Log in to your computer
* Load HicksCTE.com
* Complete the Career Summary
* Class discussion
* Activity
* Exit Survey

### Grading Procedures

All grades are based on a 3 point scale.

* 3 - Mastery (Excellent)
* 2 - Improving (Average)
* 1 - Not demonstrated (Poor)

Larger projects will be based on a multiple of 3, and scores will be adjusted accordingly based on work turned in.
