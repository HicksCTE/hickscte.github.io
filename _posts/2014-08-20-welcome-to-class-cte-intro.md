<div class="message">
  <p>Hey there! Mr. Hicks here. Welcome to my classroom! This class is going to be a little bit different than most of your other classes. We'll do a lot of our individual learning here on HicksCTE, and then we'll spend our class-time discussing, building, sharing, and connecting with others.</p>
  <p>This is one of my very favorite classes to teach. I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I enjoy teaching it. Now, let's get down to business.</p>

### Introduction to Class

#### What is CTE Intro?

CTE Intro is a year long course designed to help students explore careers, use technology, and develop beginning skills in business, technology, and in the home. In the business rotation of the course, we will look at business, technology, marketing, entrepreneurship, and software engineering.

#### Who is Mr. Hicks?

You'll learn a lot about me throughout the term. But here's a quick look at some things that are important to me.

### Grading Procedures

All grades are based on a 3 point scale.

* 3 - Mastery (Excellent)
* 2 - Improving (Average)
* 1 - Not demonstrated (Poor)

Larger projects will be based on a multiple of 3, and scores will be adjusted accordingly based on work turned in.
