Today you will follow along with the lesson in a [presentation](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/74616/intro/tresx%20promotion%20deck/assets/player/KeynoteDHTMLPlayer.html#0) file. 

## Review

We've talked about Product, Price, and Platform. In your rows discuss and review each of the 3 Ps that we've covered so far.

## Promotion

Promotion is how you get your target market interested in your product. 

Key terms: 
- Message: What the advertiser wants the potential customer to feel or do after viewing or hearing the promotion. 
- Target demographic: The ideal market segments that the marketer is trying to reach with their promotion. 
- Call to Action: What the promotion tells the customer to do after watching it (Call now! Go to our website! etc.) 

Great promotions grab *attention*, create *interest* and *desire*, and have a call to *action*.

Choose 5 videos. Discuss in your rows the following questions for each:

1. What does the commercial want you to think or feel after watching the video? (It's more than just 'Go buy it!')
2. Who is the target market for this commercial and product?
3. Is the promotion a good fit for the target market? 

### Radio or Audio

* [Shane Company](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/74616/intro/tresx%20promotion%20deck/assets/player/KeynoteDHTMLPlayer.html#32)

Can anyone in your row tell you where the Shane Company is (on the corner of ... and ...)? Or when it's open (Weekdays til... Saturdays til...)?

That is the power of repeat advertising. The Shane Company has been doing regular radio advertisements for nearly 3 decades.

Discuss in your rows:

1. Why does the Shane Company still advertise on the radio after 30 years?
2. Why is the Shane Company's radio ad effective?

### Outdoor Advertising

Outdoor advertisements, especially billboards, need to grab attention and quickly deliver the message in a memorable way. Look at these examples and decide if they are good outdoor advertisements.

* [Competing for Attention - Times Square](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/74616/intro/tresx%20promotion%20deck/assets/player/KeynoteDHTMLPlayer.html#40)

Choose 5 videos. Discuss in your rows the following questions for each:

1. What does the advertisement want you to think or feel after seeing it? (It's more than just 'Go buy it!')
2. Who is the target market for this advertisement and product?
3. Is the promotion a good fit for the target market? 

### Print Advertising

Print advertising is usually in newspapers or magazines. This can be a great way to specifically target a group of people. For example, ESPN Magazine is targeted to young fans of sports. Time Magazine to wealthy people interested in what's going on around the world. Men's Health to men interested in fitness. Etc.

* [Call to Action - Liking Isn't Helping](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/74616/intro/tresx%20promotion%20deck/assets/player/KeynoteDHTMLPlayer.html#45)

### Online Advertising

The greatest advantage to online advertising is that you can be very specific in targeting who sees your advertisements. For example, I can advertise on Facebook specifically to 11-17 year old boys who live in Lehi that are interested in Swimming or Pokemon. Specific, right?

Because of this, every advertisement you see online is specifically tailored to you somehow. Your age, your interests, your location, websites that you've visited, etc.

* [An Ad for My Wife](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/74616/intro/tresx%20promotion%20deck/assets/player/KeynoteDHTMLPlayer.html#48)
* [An Ad for Me](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/74616/intro/tresx%20promotion%20deck/assets/player/KeynoteDHTMLPlayer.html#49)

Both of these ads came from Facebook. One for my wife, one for me. Why did we get such different advertisements? Discuss in your rows.

* [Search Advertising - Google](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/74616/intro/tresx%20promotion%20deck/assets/player/KeynoteDHTMLPlayer.html#50)

Notice that almost every result on this search page is an advertisement, not the 'best' search result. Amazon, Zappos, Shoedazzle, JustFab, and Toms are all paying for the privilege of being there when you search for 'Shoes'.

Discuss the following in your tables:

1. Why would this be a great way to advertise for these companies?
2. If you are searching on Google, why might you want to ignore the ads?
3. How is online advertising great for marketers?
4. How might it not be great for you as a customer?

### Viral Marketing

You know what it means when a video or a meme 'goes viral'. Companies try and take advantage of this to market their products. The Old Spice commercial we watched earlier is an example of a paid-for Viral Marketing campaign.

* [25 million views - Viral Marketing With YouTube - Rope Swing](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/74616/intro/tresx%20promotion%20deck/assets/player/KeynoteDHTMLPlayer.html#61)
* [Another Example of YouTube Viral Marketing - Water Jumping](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/74616/intro/tresx%20promotion%20deck/assets/player/KeynoteDHTMLPlayer.html#64)

The ads may not be obvious. But there are clear links in the YouTube pages showing who is advertising these videos.

Choose 2 videos. Discuss in your rows the following questions for each:

1. What does the advertisement want you to think or feel after watching the video? (It's more than just 'Go buy it!')
2. Would you share this with your friends?

## Conclusion and Application

As you've looked through these advertisements, which have you liked? Why? Which have you disliked? Why?

How can you apply this to your TeeSpring campaigns?
