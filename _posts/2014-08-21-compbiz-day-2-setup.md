### Featured Business Essay (500 words)

You will choose and research a business. You will write a) about the founders, b) what the business does, c) how it makes money (or if it does), and d) predictions for the future of the company.

Choose any business you can think of: Facebook, Apple, Instagram, Snapchat, Minecraft, or the creators of your favorite app. If it's a company, it's fair game.

The essay will be 500 words (about 2 pages double spaced), written in Google Docs, and shared with Mr. Hicks before Saturday at midnight.

A successful entrepreneur needs to have good writing and communication skills. This assignment will demonstrate your interest in business, and should reflect a solid foundation of organized writing skills. You may want to ask for help proofreading to improve your writing.

You may use Wikipedia for research, but you may not use it as one of your citations.

#### Rubric:

* 500 words
* At least one photo
* A Works Cited section with at least 3 references aside from Wikipedia
* Proper formatting
* Organized, coherent essay

#### Short Example:

Facebook was founded by Mark Zuckerberg while he attended Harvard. He started the company as an online tool to look up and keep up with coeds at the university. He later moved to Silicon Valley, raised money, hired an army of developers, and built the company we are familiar with today. The company went public in May of 2012.

Facebook makes money on targeted advertising to the users.

Analysts predict Facebook will continue to focus on mobile advertising, business check-ins, and perhaps build a phone to continue gathering data on its vast userbase.
