The Wagon Wheel is a great opportunity to learn retail skills. Stocking, cashiering, and customer service are three of the skills you will learn working here.

Working at The Wagon Wheel is not for everyone. It can be hard and demanding. This is not something to be taken lightly. Like a real job, you can get fired or let go for not fulfilling your responsibilities.

We are taking applications for Wagon Wheel employees for 2013-2014. If you are interested in applying, you will need to fill out the application below, and turn in 3 teacher recommendations to Mr. Hicks.

If your application is accepted, you will need to attend our regular training meetings. Our initial training meeting will be held on November 6, 2013 during Flex in Mr. Hicks' room 141.

## Job Positions

**Manager**. The manager oversees that everything is going well in the store. They fill out the Daily Report. Make sure everyone fulfills their responsibilities. Covers if necessary. Reports to Mr. Hicks about any incidents.

**Cashier**. The cashier works through the line in an orderly, quick manner. Uses the iPad mini to calculate sales totals, and give change to the customer. Must have a strong personality to keep the line moving.

**Runner**. The runners fulfill orders, clean up messes, prepare Frazil, and help in any way the store needs.
